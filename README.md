This it is a basic regular expression to DFA converter based on the coursework of theory of computation.
# Features
```
- It takes an input as expression and parse it.
- Then from the abstract syntax tree it makes NFA and from NFA it is converted into DFA using the epsilon closure propery....
- Then moore minimization algorithm is used to minimize the DFA.
- An additional string check is used also(Whether the input belongs to the expression)
- worked with OR/UNION,STAR,SEQ/AND,PLUS and literals
