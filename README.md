This it is a basic regular expression to DFA converter based on the coursework of theory of computation.
# Features
1.It takes an input as expression and parse it.
2.Then from the abstract syntax tree it makes NFA and from NFA it is converted into DFA using the epsilon closure propery....
3.Then moore minimization algorithm is used to minimize the DFA.
4.An additional string check is used also(Whether the input belongs to the expression)
worked with OR/UNION,STAR,SEQ/AND,PLUS and literals
